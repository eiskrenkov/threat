end
```

2. Bundle

```

3. Import it into your Dangerfile

```

```yaml
# .github/workflows/ci.yml

name: CI

on:
  pull_request:
    branches:
      - master

        with:
          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Set up Ruby
        uses: ruby/setup-ruby@v1

      - name: Run Danger
        env:
          DANGER_GITHUB_API_TOKEN: ${{ github.token }}
        run: bundle exec danger

```

## Available plugins

1. PR Title

Validates that the Pull Request title is in correct format, containing JIRA ticket number and a meaningful short description. This works best when combined with "use pr title" + squash and merge strategy in GitHub

```ruby
# Dangerfile

danger.import_dangerfile(gem: 'threat')

pr_title.run!
```

2. TODO

Checks if there are TODOs in PR diff. Can be improved by adding logic that will check if TODO was introduced in the PR itself, in this case warning message could be rephrased

```ruby
# Dangerfile

danger.import_dangerfile(gem: 'threat')

todo.run!
```

3. Confetti ðŸŽ‰

Just add the following line at the bottom of your Dangerfile to celebrate a good run!

```ruby
# Dangerfile

danger.import_dangerfile(gem: 'threat')

# The rest of your Dangerfile goes here...

confetti.run! unless failed?
```
